A custom [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) starter project with **preconfigurations** and **templates** to help you ship quality code early and often.

## Express Server

This project uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's lightweight and great for APIs.

### Development

Using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), the express server is automatically restarted when the `src` directory changes.

```
npm run server
```

The server defaults to port `3000`. You can change it by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Production

In production, run the server using just node:

```
npm start
```

## Code Quality ðŸ‘Œ

Jasmine is preconfigured and an example spec showing how to test Express apps is included. Just as important as testing but often forgotten is linitng. As author of _Clean Code_ Robert Martin wrote:

### Unit Specs with Jasmine

Unit tests leverage the [Jasmine testing framework](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). They are executed with the standard NPM `test` command.

```
npm test
```

Unit specs:

- must use `.spec.js` as a suffix
- are preferably saved in the `/specs`, but they will be picked up anywhere
- are executed randomly

For your convenience `context()` is also aliased to `describe()`, which helps nested syntax:

```javascript
describe ('login()', () => {
  context ('valid credentials', () => {
    it ('returns true', () => {
      ...
    })
  })
  context ('invalid credentials', () => {
    it ('returns false', () => {
      ...
    })
  })
})
```

### ES Linter

This project is also linted for code consistency with the [recommended rule set](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), plus some custom changes, most notably:

[Semicolons](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi) are _not_ allowed:

```javascript
// OK
let foo = bar

// will error
let foo = 'bar';
```

[Spaces](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-before-function-paren) are _required_ before the `function` parenthesis:

```javascript
// OK
function (foo) {
  return true
}

// Fails
function(foo) {
  return true
}
```

Consistent [spacing inside curly braces](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-curly-spacing), for example:

```javascript
// OK
import { app }

// Fails
import {app}
```

To see all adjustments, see the `.eslintrc` file.

#### Autofix Problems

You can autofix most common linting offenses with this command:

```
npm run lint:fix
```

## Development Workflow

In _development_ however, you can leverage auto reloading with:

```
npm run dev
```

which will simultaneously run and watch:

- server
- unit specs
- linter

Or you can run them separately:

```
npm run server
npm run lint:watch
npm run test:watch
```

### Preflight Command

Before I push code, I like to check if it will pass all continuous integration stages with a simple command that runs all the stages:

```
npm run preflight
```

If you wanted to, you could also configure a githook to ensure all your commits are green.

## Docker Setup

For your convenience, there is an included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, which help jumpstart your microservice architecture.

These presets save you from common gotchas:

- Dockerfile: `package.json` is copied first to avoid the heavy `npm install` step on successive builds.
- `docker-compose.yml`: note that `node_modules` is mounted separately. This is required because native bindings can differ between the container and your development computer.
- Included `.dockerignore` to avoid copying giant `node_modules` folder on build.

Note these files are configured for _development only_. If you plan to use them in production, you will make adjustments, e.g. use a different base image.

## Jenkins Pipeline

There is a sample `Jenkinsfile` which a declarative pipeline including the following common stages:

- checkout
- install dependencies
- run linter
- run unit specs

## Automated Semantic Versioning

This project uses [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for automatic semantic versioning and change logs. 

1) Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits standard](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

2) When you are ready to release, just run:

```
npm run release
```

which will automatically:

- update your `CHANGELOG.md`
- tag your git repository

Depending on your commit messages, standard-version will automatically determine if it's a major, minor or patch release.
